# ANKI Automation

This script aims to help users automate the process of studying with the ANKI method. It allows users to add questions and answers for flashcards through a JSON file, which can be generated by AI to facilitate the creation of study materials. Users only need to input their questions and answers into the JSON file, and the script will automatically add them to the ANKI platform using Puppeteer.

To use this script, ensure you have your login credentials stored in the `.env` file. The script will log into your ANKI account and populate your flashcards with the data from the JSON file, streamlining your study process.
